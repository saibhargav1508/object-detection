Comparative analysis of yolo and mask r-cnn for object detection

Here are some links that can help –

Codes – I have attached my YOLO algorithm code (yolo.ipynb). The model.h5 file and weights for running the YOLO code can be found here : 
Just run this link on your browser : https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights and the weights file will download 
Running the weights file in the code will create a model file, I saved it as model.h5. See this link for reference https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/

For MRCNN, use this link https://github.com/jacob5412/Object-Detection-Comparison/tree/main/mask-rcnn
